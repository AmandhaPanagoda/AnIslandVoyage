        <p>If you’re here for the history, you’re in for one heck of a time. Sri Lanka is positively dropping in the stuff, from the cultural triangle covering Anuradhapura, Dambulla and Kandy to the numerous UNESCO world heritage sites dotted around the country.</p>
        <p>Heck, even if you’re not here for the history, you’ll find it difficult to avoid being swept up in the majesty of it all; those ancient civilizations produced some pretty incredible stuff, after all.</p>
        <p>Sri Lanka's history dates back to more than 2500 years. These ancient cities and their glorious remains that are temples, fortresses, statues and irrigation feats still have the ability to make people gaze at them with reverence. Ancient sites are considered to be archeological gold mines because they are evidence to a very rich civilization. Most of the places are declared as World Heritage Sites by the UNESCO. The oldest and the largest ancient city is Anuradhapura. <small><a href="https://www.srilankatravelandtourism.com/beautiful/ancient/ancient-srilanka.php">source link</a></small></p>

          <p>The cityscapes of Sri Lanka are a fusion of the country's varied traditions with modern architecture. The nation's commercial center, Colombo, features both colonial-era and contemporary high-rise construction. </p>
          <p>Some noteworthy highlights are Kandy's Temple of the Tooth and the picturesque views of Pettah's busy marketplaces. In addition to Colombo and Kandy, Sri Lanka's other cities, such as Galle, Jaffna, and Trincomalee, all offer unique cityscapes that reflect the country's rich history and cultural diversity. Whether exploring ancient ruins or experiencing the vibrancy of modern urban life, Sri Lanka's cities are a testament to the country's unique character and enduring spirit.</p>

          <p>Sri Lanka's Hill Country is the island at its most scenic, a mist-wrapped land of emerald peaks and stupendous views, of hillsides carpeted with tea plantations and graced by astonishing waterfalls. This is a place where you can wear a fleece in the daytime and cuddle up beside a log fire in the evening. Where you can enjoy a memorable meal in the eternal city of Kandy or at a roadside shack in lovely Ella. A region where you can walk to the end of the world, stand in the footsteps of the Buddha and be surrounded by a hundred wild elephants. Ride a train utterly bewitched by the vistas. Paddle a raft down a raging river. Enjoy the drumbeat of traditional dance and then savour the silence on a lonely mountaintop.</p>
          <p>One of the most popular destinations in the hill country is the town of Ella, which is known for its stunning views and laid-back vibe. Visitors to Ella can hike to the top of Ella Rock for panoramic views of the surrounding countryside, or take a dip in the cool waters of Ravana Falls. The town is also home to a number of charming guesthouses and cafes, where visitors can relax and soak up the mountain scenery.</p>
          <p>Another popular destination in the hill country is the town of Nuwara Eliya, which is often referred to as "Little England" due to its colonial-era architecture and cool climate. Visitors to Nuwara Eliya can visit tea plantations and factories, play a round of golf at the local course, or take a scenic train ride through the surrounding hills.</p>
          <p>Whether you're a nature lover, a history buff, or simply looking to escape the heat of the coast, Sri Lanka's hill country has something to offer. With its stunning scenery, charming towns and villages, and laid-back atmosphere, it's no wonder that this region is one of the country's top tourist destinations.</p><small>Read more about the hill country: <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/sri-lanka/the-hill-country">Hill Country Travel - Lonely Planet</a></small>

          <p>Sri Lanka is very famous for its beaches. The entire island is surrounded by blue crystal clear ocean. As a matter of fact, a lot of hotels are based near the beaches. Some beaches even have a historical significance.</p>
          <p> The beautiful, breath-taking and panoramic views of the western, southern, eastern and northern coastlines are yet another proof of choosing this island as your ultimate holiday destination. Sun-bathing and sea-bathing all year round due to the fact that the country is a tropical one. The beaches around the northern coastline are fringed with palm trees whereas the rest of the coastlines are bordered with coconut trees and thereby providing a best chance to learn how to produce toddy.</p>

          <p>The Sri Lanka department of Wildlife Conservation recently published a list of the seven most iconic wild animals in the island as a way of promoting tourism and the conservation of all species in and outside this list.</p>
          <p>Sri Lanka is somewhat of an outlier when it comes to biodiversity. Experts have been studying the biodiversity of this small island since the early 20th century, and all with good reason. The number of animal species in the island is said to be five times as much as it is supposed to be in an island of its size, and the number of endemic species in the country is amazing. From endemic birds to endemic primates, Sri Lanka has them all. The wonder of Sri Lanka – being such a small island – is that you don’t have to travel far to see any of them.</p>

          <p>Sri Lanka is home to about four different types of forest, which are found in different parts of the island. Very often, these forests have endemic species of fauna and flora which can only be found in this region. If you are a nature enthusiast, we recommend that you add a visit to a Sri Lankan forest to your itinerary. Here’s everything you need to know.</p>
          <h5>The Rain Forests</h5>
          <p>The rainforest is rich in biodiversity and accounts for 60% of the country’s 306 endemic tree species! Sinharaja is also an important catchment area for primary rivers in the southern region and because of this the forest also boasts many endemic species of fish. The rainforest experiences a biannual monsoon cycle, making it one of Sri Lanka’s wettest regions, but that only adds to the beauty of this tropical lowland rainforest.</p>
          <h5>Dry Ever-Green Forests</h5>
          <p>Situated in relatively flat areas of land and occasionally on small hillocks like Ritigala, these forests have a low level of endemism in comparison to the lowland rainforests. In spite of this, these forests house large mammals like elephants, leopards and sloth bears. These forests have a uniquely Sri Lankan charm to it; warm sunlight, rustling dry leaves and large deciduous trees which tower above their surroundings. It also feels as though the trees have a mind of their own. During the driest months the trees shed their leaves – to prevent water loss – and they are left completely barren except for the foliage on the forest floor which still remains.</p>
          <h5>Montane Forests</h5>
          <p>The cloud forests are a hallmark of the Sri Lankan hill country. Large mountains covered in lush green forests with thick plumes of mist that swirl around the tips of the mountains. Before British rule, this whole region was covered by forests and  exotic creatures dwelling deep in the forests, including monkeys, sambar deer and even Sri Lankan highland leopards. However, at the turn of the 19th century, most of these forests were cut down and turned into tea plantations by the colonisers. Now there are still a few pockets of these fantastic forests that should not be missed.</p>
          <h5>Mangrove Forests</h5>
          <p>Mangrove forests are possibly the most interesting type of forest. These forests are spread throughout the country but entering them is an otherworldly experience. Found in the brackish inland waters besides coastal towns, these forests can only be entered by boat. Mangroves are the home of vital and unique ecosystems which not only protect the flora and fauna within the forest but also absorb more carbon dioxide than a regular forest!</p>
