          <p>The culture of Sri Lanka has been influenced by many factors but has managed to retain much of its ancient aspects. Mostly it has been influenced by its long history and its Buddhist heritage. The country has a rich artistic tradition, embracing the fine arts, including music, dance, and visual arts. Sri Lankan lifestyle is reflected in the cuisine, festivals, and sports. South Indian influences are visible in many aspects. There are some influences from colonization by the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the British. Sri Lankan culture is best known abroad for its cricket, food, holistic medicine, religious icons like the Buddhist flag, and cultural exports such as tea, cinnamon and gems. Sri Lankan culture is diverse, as it varies from region to region.</p>
          <p>Sri Lanka has had ties with Indian subcontinent from ancient times. Demographics: Sinhalese 74.8%, Sri Lankan Moors 9.23%, Indian Tamil 4.16%, Sri Lankan Tamil 11.21%, Other 0.6%.</p>
          <p>Sri Lanka boasts of a documented history of over 2000 years mainly due to ancient historic scriptures like Mahawansa. Several centuries of intermittent foreign influence, has transformed Sri Lankan culture to the present outlook. Nevertheless ancient traditions and festivals are celebrated by mostly conservative Sinhalese people of the island, together with other minorities that make up the Sri Lankan identity.</p>

          <p>The cuisine of Sri Lanka draws influence from that of India, especially from Kerala, as well as colonists and foreign traders. Rice, which is usually consumed daily, can be found at any special  occasion, while spicy curries are favourite dishes for lunch and dinner. A very popular alcoholic drink is toddy or arrack, both made from palm tree sap. Rice and curry refers to a range of Sri Lankan dishes. Sri Lankans also eat hoppers (Aappa, Aappam), which can be found anywhere in Sri Lanka.</p>
          <p>Much of Sri Lanka’s cuisine consists of boiled or steamed rice served with spicy curry. Another well-known rice dish is kiribath, meaning milk rice. Curries in Sri Lanka are not just limited to meat or fish- based dishes; there are also vegetable and even fruit curries. A typical Sri Lankan meal consists of a “main curry” (fish, chicken, or mutton), as well as several other curries made with vegetable and lentils. Side-dishes include pickles, chutneys and “sambols” which can sometimes be fiery hot. The most famous of these is the coconut sambol, made of scraped coconut mixed with chilli peppers, dried Maldivian fish and lime juice. This is ground to a paste and eaten with rice, as it gives zest to the meal and is believed to increase appetite.</p>
          <p>Many of Sri Lanka’s urban areas are host to American fast food corporations and many of the younger generation have started to take a liking to this new style of cuisine although it is rejected by many, particularly the more traditional elder members of the community.</p>

          <p>The Sinhala and Tamil New Year (“Aluth Avurudhu”; in Sinhala, “Puthiyathandu”; in Tamil) is a very large cultural event on the island. The festival falls in April (also known as the month of Bak) when the sun moves from the Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to the Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries).</p>
          <p>Unusually, both the end of one year and the beginning of the next occur not at midnight but at separate times determined by astrologers with a period of some hours between (the “nona gath”; or neutral period) being a time where one is expected to refrain from all types of work and instead engage solely in relaxing religious activities and traditional games. During the New Year, festivities both children and adults will often don traditional outfits. But the clothes must be washed and very  clean because it should be southam (pure).</p>

          <p>Sri Lanka is very famous for its beaches. The entire island is surrounded by blue crystal clear ocean. As a matter of fact, a lot of hotels are based near the beaches. Some beaches even have a historical significance.</p>
          <p> The beautiful, breath-taking and panoramic views of the western, southern, eastern and northern coastlines are yet another proof of choosing this island as your ultimate holiday destination. Sun-bathing and sea-bathing all year round due to the fact that the country is a tropical one. The beaches around the northern coastline are fringed with palm trees whereas the rest of the coastlines are bordered with coconut trees and thereby providing a best chance to learn how to produce toddy.</p>

          <p>Sri Lanka is second to none in terms of its biodiversity and can be considered the best for big game safaris outside the African continent. As bold a statement as that may be, Sri Lanka’s wildlife credentials speak for itself.</p>
          <p>Alot of nature reserves and santuaries are in Sri Lanka in order to protect the wildlife from human interests that might harm the animals including poaching. Visitors are allowed in to these reserves where you can take safari trips with a trained guide provided by the reserves themselves.</p>

          <p>If you’re here for the history, you’re in for one heck of a time. Sri Lanka is positively dropping in the stuff, from the cultural triangle covering Anuradhapura, Dambulla and Kandy to the numerous UNESCO world heritage sites dotted around the country. Heck, even if you’re not here for the history, you’ll find it difficult to avoid being swept up in the majesty of it all; those ancient civilizations produced some pretty incredible stuff, after all.</p>
