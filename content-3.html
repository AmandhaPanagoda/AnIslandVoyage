          <p>The cuisine of Sri Lanka draws influence from that of India, especially from Kerala, as well as colonists and foreign traders. Rice, which is usually consumed daily, can be found at any special  occasion, while spicy curries are favourite dishes for lunch and dinner. A very popular alcoholic drink is toddy or arrack, both made from palm tree sap. Rice and curry refers to a range of Sri Lankan dishes. Sri Lankans also eat hoppers (Aappa, Aappam), which can be found anywhere in Sri Lanka.</p>
          <p>Much of Sri Lanka’s cuisine consists of boiled or steamed rice served with spicy curry. Another well-known rice dish is kiribath, meaning milk rice. Curries in Sri Lanka are not just limited to meat or fish- based dishes; there are also vegetable and even fruit curries. A typical Sri Lankan meal consists of a “main curry” (fish, chicken, or mutton), as well as several other curries made with vegetable and lentils. Side-dishes include pickles, chutneys and “sambols” which can sometimes be fiery hot. The most famous of these is the coconut sambol, made of scraped coconut mixed with chilli peppers, dried Maldivian fish and lime juice. This is ground to a paste and eaten with rice, as it gives zest to the meal and is believed to increase appetite.</p>
          <p>Many of Sri Lanka’s urban areas are host to American fast food corporations and many of the younger generation have started to take a liking to this new style of cuisine although it is rejected by many, particularly the more traditional elder members of the community.</p>

          <p>Sri Lanka is a diverse country with multiple religions practiced by its citizens. The main 
            religions in Sri Lanka are Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity.</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buddhism is the largest religion in Sri Lanka, practiced by around 70% of the population. It was introduced to Sri Lanka 
                    by Emperor Ashoka of India in the 3rd century BCE. Sri Lanka's Buddhist traditions are a blend of Theravada Buddhism and 
                    ancient animistic beliefs. The country has a rich history of Buddhist art and architecture, with many ancient temples and 
                    monuments, such as the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy and the ancient city of Anuradhapura.</li>
                <li>Hinduism is the second-largest religion in Sri Lanka, practiced by around 12.6% of the population. It was introduced to the island
                    by Indian traders and settlers around the 5th century BCE. Sri Lankan Hinduism is heavily influenced by South Indian Hinduism, with 
                    a focus on the worship of deities such as Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu, and Goddess Kali. The island has many ancient Hindu temples, such as 
                    the Nallur Kandaswamy Temple in Jaffna and the Koneswaram Temple in Trincomalee.</li>
                <li>Islam is practiced by around 9.7% of the population in Sri Lanka. It was introduced to the country by Arab traders in the 7th century CE.
                    The majority of Sri Lankan Muslims are Sunni Muslims, with a smaller population of Sufi Muslims. The country has many ancient mosques, such
                    as the Jami Ul-Alfar Mosque in Colombo, which is also known as the Red Mosque due to its distinctive red and white stripes.</li>
                <li>Christianity was introduced to Sri Lanka by Portuguese colonizers in the 16th century CE. Today, around 7.4% of the population is Christian,
                    with the majority being Roman Catholic. Sri Lankan Christianity is heavily influenced by Catholicism and Protestantism, with many ancient churches,
                    such as the St. Mary's Church in Negombo and the St. Sebastian's Church in Katuwapitiya.</li>
            </ul>
       
        <p>Overall, Sri Lanka's religious diversity has contributed to the country's unique cultural heritage, with many ancient temples, mosques, and churches dotting the 
            landscape. The country's citizens have also developed a strong sense of religious tolerance and respect for each other's beliefs, making Sri Lanka a model for 
            religious harmony.
